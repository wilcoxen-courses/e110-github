# Demonstrate Features of Markdown

The line above this is known as a level 1 heading. Leaving a blank line after it is a best practice. The line below is a level 2 heading. Adding more hashmarks creates additional levels.

Backquotes can be used to cause text to be rendered in a monospaced font `like this`, which is frequently used to show code or other things that should be used as-is, such as the names of files.

## Unnumbered list

+ Item one
+ Item two

## Numbered list

1. Item one. Adding blank lines between list items causes the rendered Markdown to have more generous spacing. It can be done with unnumbered lists as well.

1. Item two. Notice automatic number updating from 1 to 2 when the item is displayed. Also notice how the text in the previewer flows to keep subsequent lines indented by the same amount.

1. Item three.

## Code block

```python
print('hello world')
```
