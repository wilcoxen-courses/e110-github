# Exercise: GitHub Basics

## Summary

This is a starter exercise to get everyone up to speed on using GitHub and VS Code for computational assignments. It also gives me some very helpful background information.

If you're viewing this file on your computer, you can see a nicely formatted version by opening the file in VS Code and then turning on the Markdown preview pane. The pane is activated by clicking on the small "Open Preview" icon at the upper right that looks like two columns and a magnifying glass:

## Deliverables

Your finished repository should contain an updated version of **bio.md** plus a new file called **done.md**.

## Instructions

Please use VS Code or another text editor to revise the accompanying Markdown file `bio.md`. Please make the changes in the steps below. Don't do everything at once: part of the point is to see how successive revisions are logged and tracked.

1. There are five broad questions in the file. The first is about where you're from. Please edit it and replace the placeholder string `TBD` with your home town.

1. Stage that change and then commit it to your local repository with a short log message. Please do this *before* going on to make the other changes below.

1. Now go on to the remaining sections. In each case replace the letters `TBD` with a short answer to the question. The answers don't have to be long: a few words or a sentence or two are enough.

1. Stage and commit that change with an appropriate log message. It's OK to do all the changes for questions 2-5 at once.

1. Now create a new file called `done.md` with three lines:

    1. A heading line consisting of a `#`, a space, and the word `Done`. That will create a level 1 Markdown heading.

    2. A blank line. That separates the heading from the subsequent text.

    3. A line with the date.

    It's not a very interesting file but it's useful as practice in adding a new file to a repository and a quick introduction to Markdown.

1. Commit `done.md` to the repository.

## Submitting

Once you're happy with everything and have committed all of your changes to your local repository, please **push the changes** to GitHub. Don't forget to do that: if you don't push your changes, I won't be able to see them and it will look like you didn't do the assignment.

Then check that the changes are **visible on the GitHub website**. If so, you're done: you have submitted your answer and I'll be able to see and download it. If your changes aren't visible, even after refreshing the page, double-check to make sure you pushed the changes.

## Tips

+ Markdown is a very useful tool and we'll use it a fair amount this semester. To learn more, see the Markdown link in the Resources section of the class web page.
